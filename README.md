# Walmart Open API

Work with data obtained from Walmart's Open API.

## Getting Started

1. Register and Obtain API key
  + https://developer.walmartlabs.com/ 
2. R/R Studio or your preferred application(s)

## Installing, etc.

No need to reinvent the wheel here.

One issue to be mention which I ran into is: 
* When knitting from .Rmd to a PDF (mine Windows 10, MiKTeX 2.9, R Studio 1.1.453, R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23)) I had to go into MiKTeX Options | General to set "Install missing packages on the fly" to Yes.
